  - name: "First Generation (XU10)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2003
    description: "The original Lexus RX 300 pioneered the luxury crossover segment, combining SUV versatility with car-like handling and comfort. Based on the Toyota Harrier that debuted in Japan a year earlier, it featured unibody construction rather than the body-on-frame design common to SUVs of the era. Powered by a 3.0-liter V6 producing 220 horsepower paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, available in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations. The exterior design blended SUV styling cues with a sleeker, more aerodynamic shape than traditional sport utility vehicles. The elevated seating position provided the commanding view drivers sought from SUVs, while the car-based platform delivered smoother ride quality and better fuel economy. The interior offered luxury amenities including leather upholstery, premium audio options, and woodgrain trim. With its practical size, comfortable ride, and Lexus quality, the RX quickly became the brand's best-selling model in the United States and established the template for the luxury crossover segment that would soon be crowded with competitors."
